Iam a student from Egypt and I want to further my studies. This course will be beneficial to my studies. I am Abdelrahman Ataa,I am undergraduate student of BSc in Communication and Computer Engineering from the University of Engineering, Mansoura, Egypt.

I plan to start applying for fully-funded scholarships to further my studies and I need to take courses that will broaden my horizon and enhance my chances.

Financial Aid will help me take this course without any cost to me because I am not financially buoyant. So I'm really in need of this financial aid. I want to take this course as I want to learn. This course will boost my Masters Degree prospects. It will help me perform better in writing outstanding Statements of Purpose (SOP) and to perform well during interviews. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course. I plan to complete all assignments on or before time. Also, I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments that are to peer review which I believe will be a valuable learning opportunity. It is against this background that I seek financial aid to attend courses like this because it will contribute immensely to my existing knowledge in the field of Botany and also help in achieving my career goal.

Dear Coursera Financial Aid team,
